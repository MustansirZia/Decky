# Decky.
#### Decky is an android application written in Kotlin.

##### It was built upon [loopeer/CardStackView](https://github.com/loopeer/CardStackView).

It has a deck of cards that are fully draggable on the screen, are filterable and can be sorted alphabetically.

Styling was done using <b>[Google's flexbox-layout](https://github.com/google/flexbox-layout). </b>
<br /> <b>`ENUMS`</b> are used to filter data and animations are vanilla Android. No animation library is used.
<br /> Custom fonts are added using <b>[Typography](https://github.com/workarounds/typography).
